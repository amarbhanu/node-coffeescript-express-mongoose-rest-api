============================

a quick MVC skeleton for creating a RESTful server using express.js and mongoose.
if you want to create a REST server and keep your code clean and lean - try this skeleton. 
I added a sample for a `user` model.

to install:

0. make sure you have node.js and coffeescript install
1. add your mongodb URI under `config/environment.coffee`
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`
4. go drink some beer
